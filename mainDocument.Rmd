This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Now the Rmd file get's more and more processed...
Adding the new Folder

Now we have to do something and therefore we create a new branch and do the changes here and then doing an
Fast-Forward-Merge to to main-branch
Enter more content (first commit)
There are some even more changes necessary (second commit)
Now there must be done some enhancements (third commit)

Doing a push after the pull request

Again a commit Enhancements 1
The second commit for Enhancements


A [link](https://github.com/tueftla1/RMarkdown_Trial/blob/main/docs/Documents/YAMLHeader.Rmd) to the rmd file and a <a href="/RMarkdown_Trial/Documents/YAMLHeader.html">link</a> to the rendered html file.
Is it also possible to do the first [link](https://tueftla1.github.io/RMarkdown_Trial/Documents/YAMLHeader.Rmd) in another way?!

And perhaps some more info is given soon...
